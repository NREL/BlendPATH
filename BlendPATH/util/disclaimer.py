This tool is intended for use during the early stages of pipeline repurposing concept evaluation, which is defined here as the initial project phase when the developer has already gathered the relevant pipeline material design and operation data but has not yet conducted the detailed pipeline materials testing, as specified in ASME B31.12, or performed the in-line inspections that qualify a given pipeline section for hydrogen or hydrogen blending service. Despite BlendPATH using ASME B31.12 to assess existing natural gas transmission pipelines and establish potential pipeline modifications for a natural gas transmission pipeline network to meet ASME B31.12 design requirements, BlendPATH does not qualify the examined pipeline network or modifications thereof for pure hydrogen or hydrogen blending. Further, actual natural gas transmission pipeline network assessment and qualification will require additional evaluations, independent of BlendPATH application, as specified in ASME B31.12. It is the sole responsibility of the pipeline owner and operator to ensure that their pipeline qualifies for the ASME B31.12 design option that they choose, and any other relevant regulations, and that any defects present in the pipeline are acceptable at the operating pressure chosen.\n----------------------------\n"
